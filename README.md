CloudWatch Agent for ECS Instance Metrics

The sample ECS task definitions in this folder deploy the CloudWatch Agent as a DaemonService. For more information, see Setting Up Container Insights on Amazon ECS.



You must replace all the placeholders (with {{ }}) in the above task definitions with your information:

    {{task-role-arn}}: ECS task role ARN.
        This is role that you application containers will use. The permission should be whatever your applications need.
        Additionally, ensure that the CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy policy is attached to your ECS Task Role.

    {{execution-role-arn}}: ECS task execution role ARN.
        This is the role that Amazon ECS requires to launch/execute your containers, e.g. get the parameters from SSM parameter store.
        Ensure that the AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess, AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy and CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy policies are attached to your ECS Task execution role.
        If you would like to store more sensitive data for ECS to use, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/specifying-sensitive-data.html.

    {{awslogs-region}}: The AWS region where the container logs should be published: e.g. ap-south-1

You can also adjust the resource limit (e.g. cpu and memory) based on your particular use cases.
